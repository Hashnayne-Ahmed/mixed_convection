**Overview**

The paper investigates the intricate interplay between mixed convection heat transfer and fluid flow in a square enclosure containing heated obstacles, with a focus on the utilization of Al₂O₃-water nanofluid. The study delves into how factors such as the Richardson number, Reynolds number, cylinder rotating speed, and cavity inclination angles affect the thermal environment and flow dynamics within the enclosure. By exploring a wide range of parameter variations, from Richardson and Reynolds numbers to cylinder rotation speeds and cavity inclination angles, the research sheds light on the nuanced impacts on heat transfer and fluid motion.

One key finding is that the addition of nanoparticles to the base fluid, in this case, Al₂O₃-water nanofluid, leads to an enhancement in the heat transfer rate around the heated obstacles across all parameter ranges studied. Furthermore, the paper highlights the significance of factors such as wavy walls, changes in nanofluid composition, and positional effects on flow characteristics and heat transfer processes within the enclosure. Overall, the study contributes valuable insights into the complex mechanisms governing heat transfer and fluid dynamics in confined spaces with heated obstacles, offering implications for various engineering applications.

**Mesh**

The mesh generation process utilizes the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5 and relevant meshing facilities. The final triangular mesh selection are determined based on the average Nusselt number calculations.

**Methodology**

The modified Galerkin weighted residual Finite Element Technique is chosen for its ability to accurately capture the convective terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, which govern fluid flow.

**Requirements**

The generation of datasets necessitates the installation of COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5 or later. The approximate runtime for this simulation is 3 hours.
